- Implement and test implicit type promotion to bool for:
	- while
	- if
	- loop repeat
	- assert
	- next if/break if
	- ternary operator
	- logical and/or and not
- Implement and unit test implicit casting on 'return'
- Allow an extra ',' at the end of array literals
	- Also write a test for this
- Implicit casting of pointers to 'any' pointers
- '! operator'
- [] operator should dereference pointers
- Don't allow dereference of nullable pointers
- Emit a compile error if an integer literal can't fit in it's type

- Unit test use of 'any' pointers and casting to/from them
- Unit test implicit casting to and from any pointers
	- Check logic for all the cases
- Unit test implicit casting of 'null'
	- Test to 'any' ptrs, 
	- Test to nullable ptrs.
	- Test to bool
	- This DOESN'T WORK:
		let blah : bool = null
- Unit test various runtime integer implicit casting
- Unit test implicit cast of pointers to bool
- Unit test allowed compile time implicit casts
	- Especially for ints
- Unit test implicit casting non nullable pointer to nullable pointer of the same type
- Unit test implicit type promotion for binary expressions
- Unit test implicit type promotion to bool for:
	- while
	- if
	- loop repeat
	- assert
	- next if/break if
	- ternary operator
	- logical and/or and not
- Unit test binary expression left to right and right to left implicit casting

- Fix up random 'new' allocations throughout the codebase
	- Use linear alloc

- Fix this bug:
	let blah : uint = 18_446_744_073_709_551_615

- Fix this bug:
    let blah = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    let blahPtr = &blah
    print(($blahPtr)[1])

- Fix this bug:
	func blah()
	    print("Hello")
	end

	func main() -> int
	    let test = blah
	    test()
	    return 0
	end
