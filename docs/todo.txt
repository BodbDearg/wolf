- Pointer arithmetic: add

- Pointers:
    - behave exactly like 'c' pointers
    - pointer dereference operator is '$'
    - '^' for non nullable pointer
    - '?' for nullable pointer
    - '!' to convert a nullable into non nullable pointer
    - 'null' keyword for null pointers

- Primitive Data types folder is contains lots of non primitive types. Remove?

- Fix up random 'new' allocations throughout the codebase
	- Use linear alloc

- Fix this bug:
	func blah()
	    print("Hello")
	end

	func main() -> int
	    let test = blah
	    test()
	    return 0
	end
