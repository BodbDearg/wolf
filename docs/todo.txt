- Don't allow dereference of nullable pointers

********************** 
***** Priority 2 *****
**********************

- Don't allow taking the address (using '&' operator of object returned from function)
	- Might need to introduce the concept of l-values versus r-values to fix this one...

- Bug fix getting the address of a function call that returns a non array type (type that doesn't need storage)

- Do a review of error handling in all the AST node types and see if we are emitting redundant error msgs.

- Emit a compile error if an integer literal can't fit in it's type

- Fix up random 'new' allocations throughout the codebase
	- Use linear alloc

- Fix this bug:
	let blah : uint = 18_446_744_073_709_551_615

- Fix this bug:
	func blah()
	    print("Hello")
	end

	func main() -> int
	    let test = blah
	    test()
	    return 0
	end
