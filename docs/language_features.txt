Modules:
    - Each translation unit compiles to a module stub
    - Module stub hides non public members
    - Module stub defines size info of type

    void:       empty/no-type
    int8:		8-bit signed integer
    uint8:		8-bit unsigned integer
    int16:		16-bit signed integer
    uint16:		16-bit unsigned integer
    int32:		32-bit signed integer
    uint32:		32-bit unsigned integer
    int64:		64-bit signed integer
    uint64:		64-bit unsigned integer
    int128:		128-bit signed integer
    uint128:	128-bit unsigned integer
    char8:		8-bit unsigned character type
    char16:		16-bit unsigned character type
    char32:		32-bit unsigend character type
    float16:    16-bit floating point number
    float32:    32-bit floating point number
    float64:    64-bit floating point number
    float80:    80-bit floating point number

Primitive Type Aliases:
	int:    Machine word sized signed int (e.g int64 on 64-bit system)
    uint: 	Machine word sized unsigned int (e.g uint64 on 64-bit system)
    char: 	char8 by default (for utf8)
    uchar:  char32 by default (for utf32)
    float:  float32 by default (for single precision)
